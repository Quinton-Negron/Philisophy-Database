How to

1) Make sure that you have an Author.csv, Era.csv, School.csv, Language.csv, Topic.csv, Prerequisite.csv, PreN.csv, and N1.csv file

2) You must load 9 different files (Author, Era, School, Language, Topic, Prerequisite, PreNormalized, N1). 

3) the first 7 tables are just for getting a 1:1 result.

4) PreNormalization is for results that are non-atomic, meanwhile N1 is for atomic results (Entries have their own row).

5) If you want to pick a result you specify by writing Select * from [attribute] where [attribute] = '[entry]';

For example, Select * from Language where Language = 'Latin'; 

gives you only results relating to Latin 

6) If you want to have multiple entries then you write Select * from [attribute] where [attribute] = '[entry]' and [attribute] = '[entry]';

For example, select * from N1 where Prerequisite = 'new' and Topic = 'Epistemology';

gives you results only relating to new entries for Epistemology.
